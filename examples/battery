    Invoked periodically
    
    If you want to control at what to invoke this function next time
    you can set the value of the global variable `wait_period` to the
    number of seconds to wait before invoking this function again.
    The value does not need to be an integer.
    
    @param  year:int     The year
    @param  month:int    The month, 1 = January, 12 = December
    @param  day:int      The day, minimum value is 1, probable maximum value is 31 (*)
    @param  hour:int     The hour, minimum value is 0, maximum value is 23
    @param  minute:int   The minute, minimum value is 0, maximum value is 59
    @param  second:int   The second, minimum value is 0, probable maximum value is 60 (**)
    @param  weekday:int  The weekday, 1 = Monday, 7 = Sunday
    @param  fade:float?  Blueshift can use this function to fade into a state when it start
                         or exits. `fade` can either be negative, zero or positive or `None`,
                         but the magnitude of value cannot exceed 1. When Blueshift starts,
                         this function will be invoked multiple with the time parameters
                         of the time it is invoked and each time `fade` will increase towards
                         1, starting at 0, when the value is 1, the settings should be applied
                         to 100 %. After this this function will be invoked once again with
                         `fade` being `None`. When Blueshift exits the same behaviour is used
                         except, `fade` decrease towards -1 but start slightly below 0, when
                         -1 is reached all settings should be normal. Then Blueshift will NOT
                         invoke this function with `fade` being `None`, instead it will by
                         itself revert all settings and quit.
