# This requires the following in your xmonad logHook:
# 
#    dynamicLogString defaultPP
#      { ppSort = getSortByXineramaRule
#      } >>= xmonadPropLog
# 
# It also requires (to be modified or) that each workspace's name
# is the workspaces index or the workspaces index followed by dash.
# The first workspaces must 1. For example:
#
#    workspaces = ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8-mail", "9-video"]
# 
# Additionally python3-xlib is required to be installed.

    :(int, int, int, int, int, int, int, float?)?→void  Place holder for periodically invoked function
    
    Invoked periodically
    
    If you want to control at what to invoke this function next time
    you can set the value of the global variable `wait_period` to the
    number of seconds to wait before invoking this function again.
    The value does not need to be an integer.
    
    @param   year:int     The year
    @param   month:int    The month, 1 = January, 12 = December
    @param   day:int      The day, minimum value is 1, probable maximum value is 31 (*)
    @param   hour:int     The hour, minimum value is 0, maximum value is 23
    @param   minute:int   The minute, minimum value is 0, maximum value is 59
    @param   second:int   The second, minimum value is 0, probable maximum value is 60 (**)
    @param   weekday:int  The weekday, 1 = Monday, 7 = Sunday
    @param   fade:float?  Blueshift can use this function to fade into a state when it start
                          or exits. `fade` can either be negative, zero or positive or `None`,
                          but the magnitude of value cannot exceed 1. When Blueshift starts,
                          the this function will be invoked multiple with the time parameters
                          of the time it is invoked and each time `fade` will increase towards
                          1, starting at 0, when the value is 1, the settings should be applied
                          to 100 %. After this this function will be invoked once again with
                          `fade` being `None`. When Blueshift exits the same behaviour is used
                          except, `fade` decrease towards -1 but start slightly below 0, when
                          -1 is reached all settings should be normal. Then Blueshift will NOT
                          invoke this function with `fade` being `None`, instead it will by
                          itself revert all settings and quit.
