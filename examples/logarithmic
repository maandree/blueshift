import math

# Use linear RGB.
linearise()

# Make the curves logarithmic. The function applies
# to the red (first argument) and green (second
# argument) colour curves. `...` is used to use the
# same value as the argument before it. `None`,
# which is used for the blue colour curve, means
# that no adjustment is made, which is the same
# thing as using `lambda x : x`.
manipulate(lambda x : math.log(x + 1, 2), ..., None)

# Switch back to sRGB.
standardise()

# Alternatively you can use `cie_manipulate` instead
# of `manipulate`. To to the logaritmisation in the
# CIE xyY colour space. If doing so, do not use
# `linearise`–`standardise`.

# Apply settings, using vidmode.
