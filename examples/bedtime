                          or exits. `fade` can either be negative, zero or positive or `None`,
                          but the magnitude of value cannot exceed 1. When Blueshift starts,
                          this function will be invoked multiple with the time parameters
                          of the time it is invoked and each time `fade` will increase towards
                          1, starting at 0, when the value is 1, the settings should be applied
                          to 100 %. After this this function will be invoked once again with
                          `fade` being `None`. When Blueshift exits the same behaviour is used
                          except, `fade` decrease towards -1 but start slightly below 0, when
                          -1 is reached all settings should be normal. Then Blueshift will NOT
                          invoke this function with `fade` being `None`, instead it will by
                          itself revert all settings and quit.
