# This example covers most of what Blueshift offers. For a complete
# coverage of Blueshift complement this example with:
#   backlight, crtc-detection, crtc-searching, logarithmic,
#   stored-settings, modes, textconf, icc-profile-atoms
# However the are features that are only covered by the info manual:
#   Methods for calculating correlated colour temperature

                         of the time it is invoked and each time `fade` will increase towards
                         1, starting at 0, when the value is 1, the settings should be applied
                         to 100 %. After this this function will be invoked once again with
                         `fade` being `None`. When Blueshift exits the same behaviour is used
                         except, `fade` decrease towards -1 but start slightly below 0, when
                         -1 is reached all settings should be normal. Then Blueshift will NOT
