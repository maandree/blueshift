# settings to. An empty list means that all monitors are used,
# but all monitors will have the same settings.

# These settings are lists. This is to allow you to use different
# settings on different monitors. For example, `gamma_red = [1]`,
# this means that the red gamma is 1 on all monitors. But if we
# change this to `gamma_red = [1.0, 1.1]`, the first monitor will
# have the red gamma set to 1,0 and the second monitor will have
# the red gamma set to 1,1. If you have more monitors than used
# in the settings modulo division will be used. For instance, if
# you have four monitors, the third monitor will have the same
# settings as the first monitor, and the fourth monitor will have
# the same settings as the second monitor.
