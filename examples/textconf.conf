[blueshift] ; General settings and adjustments shared between monitors

adjustment-method-x = randr ; (default) vidmode is also available
; This is the method used to set and get colour curves for monitors
; when running in X.

adjustment-method-tty = drm ; (default)
; This is the method used to set and get colour curves for monitors
; when running in TTY.

location = 59.3326 18.0652
; Your geographical location as GPS coordinates in decimal form. If you
; are on the south hemisphere the first value should be negative, if you
; are on the west side of the prime meridian (the Greenwich meridian).
; If you are not sure about your location you probably find it in your
; online phone book or on Wikipedia.
; ("Kristall, vertikal accent i glas och stål" (Crystal, vertical accent
; in glass and steal) in this example. A glass obelisk, lit from the inside
; with adjustable colours and a default colour of 5600 K, in the middle
; of a hyperelliptic roundabout.)

;location = 59.3326$(locateme | cut d ' ' -f 1) 18.0652$(locateme | cut d ' ' -f 2)
; Just loke above, but use the values as fallback and use the output
; of the command `locateme` primarily.


points = solar 3 -6 ; (default)
; Adjustment settings have up to two values, one for when the Sun's
; elevation is above 3° (day) and one for when it is below −6° (night).

;points = solar -18 -12 -6 0 6
; Adjustment settings have up to five values that depend on the Sun's
; elevation: at and below −18°, at −12°, at −6°, at 0° and at and above
; 6°. Interpolation of values are used between these points to give nice
; transitions.

;points = solar -18 0 3 6 reduce
; Adjustment settings have up to two values. When the Sun's elevation is
; at or below −18° the first value is used, when it is at or above 6° the
; second value is used. Between −18° and 6° interpolation is used to give
; nice transitions: at 0° two thirds of the first value and one third of
; the second value is used, and at 3° on third of the first value and two
; thirds of the second value is used.

;point = time 6:00 10:00 20:00
; Adjustment settings have up to three values. At 6:00 the first value is
; used, at 10:00 the second value is used and at 20:00 the third value is
; used. Between 6:00 and 10:00 interpolation between first and second
; value is used, between 10:00 and 20:00 interpolation between the second
; and third valu is used, and between 20:00 and 4:00 interpolation between
; the third and first value is used.

;points = time 6:00 10:00 20:00 reduce
; Adjustment settings have up to two values. At 6:00 the first value is
; used, and at 20:00 the second setting is used. Interpolation is used
; between between 20:00 and 6:00, but between 6:00 and 20:00 interpolation
; is used with the adjustment that both the first and the second value
; is used to 50 % each at 10:00.

; TODO: the following should be possible
;   points = solar -18 (0) 3 (6) 12 reduce
;   points = time 6:00 (10:00) 20:00 reduce
;   points = time 6:00 (10:00) 20:00 (2:00) reduce


; For the following settings you can also add the word ‘linear’, just
; as ‘cie’ can be used on some settings. ‘linear’ (which is supported
; on all adjustments) performs the adjustments in linear RGB colour
; space. ‘cie’ (which is only supported where used in this example)
; performs the adjustments in CIE xyY colour space. ‘linear’ and ‘cie’
; can be combined but should not be combined as it has no proper meaning.
; Additional, while possible, ‘linear’ should not be used with ‘icc’,
; as that too has no proper meaning.

; All of this adjustments can have multiple values, but in this example
; only ‘temperature’ uses this. We have set “points = solar 3 -6”, which
; means that the first setting is used during the day and the second is
; used between civil dusk and civil dawn (night). The other settings
; only use one value (in this example) which means that those apply all
; day long.

; The order of adjustments are made in the order they are listed. which
; means that putting gamma before temperature produces another result
; than putting temperature before gamma. Monitor specific adjustments
; are made after these adjustments.


temperature = 6500 3600
; 6500 K (neutral) during the day, and 3600 during the night.

;contrast = 0.5
; Converge white and black both halfways to 50 % grey.

;contrast = 1:1:0.5 cie
; Converge white and black both halfways to 50 % grey,

;brightness = 0.75
; Reduce the brightness of the white colour to 75 % grey.

;brightness = 1:0.75:1 cie
; Reduce the brightness of the white colour to 75 % grey,
; but only on the green channel.

;negative = 1
; Apply a negative image filter, this reverses the
; encoding values.

;negative = 1:0:0

; output values. But do not do it on the red channel.

;invert = 1 cie
; Apply an image inversion filter.

;sigmoid = 4.5
; Apply a sigmoid curve (S-curve) correction
; (cancellation) with a multiplier level of 4,5.

; level of 4,5, but not on the green channel.

;gamma = 1.1

; (black is 0; first parameter) and 90 % white (white
; is 1; second parameter.)

;limits = 0:0.1:0.1..1:0.9:0.9 cie
; Apply a brightness–contrast correction of 90 % black
; and 90 % white, but not on the red channel.

;icc = /home/user/.config/icc/filter
; Apply an ICC profile with the pathname
; ‘/home/user/.config/icc/filter’.

;backlight = 1
; Apply backlight adjustment. This requires that
; the backlight device has been specified.


; Here begins monitor identification and specific
; specifc calibrations/filters for the primary monitor.


[monitor 0] ; Adjustment method independent settings for monitor 0
gamma = 1.16:1.15:1.11 default
; Gamma correction of 1.16 on red, 1.15 on green and 1.11 on blue.
; ‘default’ is used so that this correction is used when at the
; beginning of a transition from a clean state to a state with
; the adjustments in effect, at which time these adjustments will
; still apply.

backlight-device = none
; Device in ‘/sys/class/backlight/’ used to control the
; backlight of the monitor. ‘none’ if no controller.

backlight-minimum = 0 ; (default)
; Artificial minimum backlight value that can be used in
; ‘/sys/class/backlight/${backlight-device}/brightness’.
; Some devices freezes at if the value is top low so that
; the computer needs to be restarted. This can used so
; that it does not happen.
