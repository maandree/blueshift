:(int, int, int, int, int, int, int, float?)?→void  Place holder for periodically invoked function

Invoked periodically

If you want to control at what to invoke this function next time
you can set the value of the global variable `wait_period` to the
number of seconds to wait before invoking this function again.
The value does not need to be an integer.

@param  year:int     The year
@param  month:int    The month, 1 = January, 12 = December
@param  day:int      The day, minimum value is 1, probable maximum value is 31 (*)
@param  hour:int     The hour, minimum value is 0, maximum value is 23
@param  minute:int   The minute, minimum value is 0, maximum value is 59
@param  second:int   The second, minimum value is 0, probable maximum value is 60 (**)
@param  weekday:int  The weekday, 1 = Monday, 7 = Sunday
@param  fade:float?  Blueshift can use this function to fade into a state when it start
                     or exits. `fade` can either be negative, zero or positive or `None`,
                     but the magnitude of value cannot exceed 1. When Blueshift starts,
                     this function will be invoked multiple with the time parameters
                     of the time it is invoked and each time `fade` will increase towards
                     1, starting at 0, when the value is 1, the settings should be applied
                     to 100 %. After this this function will be invoked once again with
                     `fade` being `None`. When Blueshift exits the same behaviour is used
                     except, `fade` decrease towards -1 but start slightly below 0, when
                     -1 is reached all settings should be normal. Then Blueshift will NOT
                     invoke this function with `fade` being `None`, instead it will by
                     itself revert all settings and quit.
