    Airports should publish METAR (Meteorological Aerodrome Report) reports at XX:20 and XX:50,
    it can presumable take some time before the collection server we use (weather.noaa.gov) have
    received it. Additionally some airports do not update while closed, and updates while closed
    are less accurate.
    
    @param   station:str?                     The station's International Civil Aviation
                                              Organization airport code. If `None`,
                                              $HOME/.config/metar is read, with fallback to
                                              ~/.config/metar and /etc/metar.
    @param   downloader:(url:str)?→list<str>  A function that, with an URL as input, returns
                                              a command to download the file at the URL to stdout
    @return  :(sky:str, visiblity:(:int, :float)?, weather:list<str>)?
                            The sky condition, visiblity and weather. Sky condition values include
                            ‘clear’, ‘mostly clear’, ‘partly cloudy’, ‘mostly cloudy’, ‘overcast’
                            and ‘obscured’. The visibility consists of two parameters: the first
                            on indicates the the visiblity is a upper bound if the value is -1,
                            a lower bound if +1, and approximate if 0; the second parameter is the
                            visibility in kilometers. If the visibility is unknown the value will
                            be `None`. The weather is a list that can, and often is, empty. `None`
                            is return if observation data cannot be downloaded.
